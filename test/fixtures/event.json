Hence the only way is to retrieve all the activities for a user is as done [here](https://github.com/joshsoftware/code-curiosity/blob/master/app/models/activities_fetcher.rb#L19) and filter the required activities. Also, it might not retrieve all activities as in this [issue](https://github.com/piotrmurach/github/issues/286) and hence the point calculation is still going to be a bit wrong."
